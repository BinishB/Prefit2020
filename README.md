# Prefit2020

This is the GitHub area with all of the inputs you'll need for the hands-on part of the "Fitting sessions". 
You should already have access to the `VirtualMachine` (VM) - it's the same one you used for the Madgraph/EFT hands-on sessions. 

To clone this repository, type the following into a terminal inside your VM 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amarini/Prefit2020.git
```

Each session has its own sub-folder, so make sure to navigate there first before trying the hands on part. 

Enjoy!
